Nested sectioning elements with the class `.container` serve as additional style aids since you do not have access to alter the base HTML. IDs are included where needed for nav anchors or accessibility, and a small number of additional classes are provided for key elements without IDs. Don't forget the `.skip-link`!</td>

You may use any build setup you prefer, but the final submission should be the compiled, unminified CSS. You retain the copyright to original graphics and must ensure all graphics used are appropriately licensed. All asset links, including fonts, must be absolute to external resources.

                <td colspan="2">Ensure your design is responsive, and that it passes accessible contrast (we'll be using aXe to verify). Animations should be removed via `prefers-reduced-motion`. Cutting-edge techniques should come with a fallback if needed to not severely impact the user experience. No content may be permanently hidden, and hidden items must come with an accessible viewing technique. Page load time should not exceed 3 seconds.</td>
